Minecraft-like game developed following LWJGL 3D game development tutorial. https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/lwjglgamedev/3d-game-development-with-lwjgl/details
On this project I mainly focused on multithreading world loading and better data structure for the world.
This is second iteration of my minecraft project developed using LWJGL.
What I learned:
Multithreaded world generation.
RLE encoded world saving/loading.
More general 3d game programming techniques.
